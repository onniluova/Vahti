Vahti is a custom API monitoring tool designed to track endpoint availability and performance.

This project was built to demonstrate a full production pipeline: from a Python backend to a deployed cloud architecture using Render and Vercel.

## Live Demo

# **URL:** https://vahti-web.vercel.app

> **Note:** The backend is hosted on Render's free tier. The server spins down after inactivity, so the first request may take 30-50 seconds to process.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Axios.
* **Backend:** Python 3.11, Flask (MVC Architecture), Gunicorn.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL.
* **Security:** JWT Authentication, zxcvbn (password strength estimation), BCrypt hashing.
* **DevOps:** Render (Backend), Vercel (Frontend), Git.

## Key Features

* **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based login and signup flow. Includes robust password strength enforcement using Dropbox's `zxcvbn` library to prevent weak credentials.
* **Endpoint Management:** Full CRUD operations for adding, monitoring, and deleting API targets.
* **Real-time Checks:** Manual trigger to verify status code and latency (ms) instantly.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Statistical analysis engine that compares the current request latency against the moving average of the last 10 checks. It flags performance degradation before the service goes offline.
* **Responsive UI:** Dashboard built with Tailwind CSS, fully responsive for desktop and mobile.

## Project Structure

The project is managed as a Mono-repo to streamline development.

## Local setup

### Backend
1. Navigate to the root directory.
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` & `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET_KEY`.
5. Run the server: `python run.py`

### Frontend
1. Navigate to `/frontend`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`

## Roadmap

* [x] Refactor backend to MVC structure.
* [x] Implement JWT Authentication & Password Strength Check.
* [x] Deploy to Production (Render/Vercel).
* [x] Implement APScheduler for background interval monitoring (1min/5min checks).
* [x] Visualize historical latency data with Recharts.
* [x] Add timeline selection to charts.
* [x] Implement settings menu.
* [ ] Administration tools for user and endpoint monitoring.
